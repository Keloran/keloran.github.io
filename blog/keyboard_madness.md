### Keyboard madness
Well I finally pulled the plug and bought a Planck,

rather than build my own though I went with a [Planck EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck)
 also rather than buy 1 like any sensible person, when it costs nearly 300 quid, I bought 2

and because obviously I'm npt to be trusted I decided to flash one and learn Workman, I have a couple of firmwares if anyone else is insane like me

[Workman](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/4OG3M/latest/0) this layout is workman, but also moves the numbers on the upper layer to a reverse T pattern is the easiest way to explain it

[Keloran](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/9wP73/latest/0) this is qwerty, but with its numbers also in the reverse T pattern

they are really good keyboards, and I would honestly say one of the best keyboard I've ever owned
