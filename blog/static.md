### Static Generator
#### 2019-11-28
Started a index generator, all it does is reads the projects and blog directory,
* if there are pages in the project folder
  * current folder, add to that section
  * past folder, add to that section
* if its in blog folder it adds those to that section

Very simple, I'll add more features in future, but this is just very simple
