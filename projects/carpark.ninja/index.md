##  CarPark.Ninja
This is a carparking platform so that you can easily choose a contract carpark near where you work before you start your job, or have to find the details from a random poster, 

get the price of the contact before you send your details, rather than getting spammed constantly if you decide not to take it

also it has the option of what is JustPark (I didn't know this existed, and once I found out competion is always good)
