### Dotfiles Loader
#### 2020-08-05
I've decided that I should really get my dotfiles into some sort of managable fashion, whilst yes it does work at the moment, it would be better to have some sort of fallback design so that if the installs fails it doesn'
t have to basiclly start all over again

It follows a very simple syntax of folders and json files so that it knows what todo, it only really works on osx but I have it building in linux and macos
