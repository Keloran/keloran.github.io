### Minecraft Query
This is a essentially a port of [PHP-Minecraft-Query](://github.com/xpaw/php-minecraft-query) from xPaw
but in go, it works for Java at the moment, but will be made to work with bedrock too

###  CarPark.Ninja
This is a carparking platform so that you can easily choose a contract carpark near where you work before you start your job, or have to find the details from a random poster, 

get the price of the contact before you send your details, rather than getting spammed constantly if you decide not to take it

also it has the option of what is JustPark (I didn't know this existed, and once I found out competion is always good)

### BugFix.es  
This is a bug tracking system, any time an error happens on your site it tells bugfixes in the agent for your language, 

then if the error occurs quickly or once in a while it informs the user some how

nothing is public yet (the javascript version released needs fixing)
